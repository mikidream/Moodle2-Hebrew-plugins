Course Appointments block for Moodle

This block provides a form for teachers to book 1 to 1 appointments with Students on a class. The
student can be notified of the appointment, and it will be added to both users' calendars.

To install, place all files in /blocks/course_appointments and visit /admin/index.php in your
